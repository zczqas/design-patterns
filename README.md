# What is this repository?

Nothing serious just exploration of Design Patterns by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.

I have not explored all the design patterns and there are tons but ones that are recommended by NeetCode.

I highly advise you learn OOP and design patterns.
Goodluck!!
